### Moodzy

Moodzy is a simple webapp designed to survey your name and mood! Join a community of people!

Note: This project was created to experiment with Vue, Node / Express, and GPBs. It's an intentionally small project with the multi-user / authentification portion intentionally cut out.

#### How to run:

STEP 1: 
STEP 1: from one terminal, navigate to the backend folder, run `npm i` and then run `npm run dev`

STEP 2: in another terminal window, navigate to the frontend folder, run `npm i` and then run `npm run dev`

STEP 3: open localhost:5173 (if not auto-opened) and enjoy the demo!
