## Moodzy

Moodzy is a simple webapp designed to survey your name and mood! Join a community of people!

Note: This project was created to experiment with Vue, Node / Express, and GPBs. It's an intentionally small project with the multi-user / authentification portion intentionally cut out.

### System Design:
